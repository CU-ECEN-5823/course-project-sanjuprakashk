# April 13th, 2019 - Project Update 1  

1) Interfaced accelerometer and tested fall detection functionality  
2) Implemented simple publish feature  


# April 20th, 2019 - Project Update 2  

1) Configured accelerometer to detect taps  
2) Implemented Low Power Node that publishes and subscribes using mesh level model  

Working:  
1) If fall or tap is detected a buzzer starts to sound and status is published to the friend node  
2) Friend node responds with a signal to turn off the buzzer  

# Tasks for upcoming week  
1) OOB authentication and persistent storage  
2) Using more than one mesh model for communication  
3) Making both tap detection and fall detection work together
